LENDING AND BORROWING
Introduction
Welcome to Lending and Borrowing, a decentralized finance (DeFi) application where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn passive income, while borrowers can borrow collateralized . The platform is designed to manage loans, collateral, and interest rates in a decentralized and transparent system.
Key Features
Price Oracle: Price feeds and automation through Chainlink ensure data accuracy and reliable execution of contract functions.
Collateral Management: The platform supports dynamic collateral management with real-time monitoring and liquidation mechanisms.
Lending Pool: Users can deposit digital assets into the lending pool and earn interest over time.
Borrowing: Users can borrow assets by providing collateral. The loan amount depends on the value of the collateral and the health factor.
Automated Interest Calculation: Interest rates are calculated based on supply and demand, with automatic updates for lenders and borrowers.
Secure Liquidation: If a loan's health factor drops below a certain threshold, the system triggers liquidation to protect lenders.
Technology Stack
Smart Contracts: Built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity.
Hardhat: Development environment for writing and testing smart contracts.
Chainlink Oracles: For fetching off-chain data such as asset prices.
ChainLink Automation: Automate important tasks sush as Health Factor Monitoring and Automatic Liquidation
React: Frontend framework for user interface and interaction.
Next.js: Framework for building server-side rendering and static web applications.
Wagmi: React hooks library for Ethereum, used for blockchain interactions.
